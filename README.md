# Jordan Sdk Network Libraries

This C# SDK provides low level components that make it very easy to use protocols such as TCP, UDP or Web sockets. These components will be the building blocks of a C# socket server framework, hopefully used by game developers or for any kind of project that requires easy access to these networking protocols.
