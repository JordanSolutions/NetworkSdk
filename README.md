# Jordan Sdk Network Libraries

This C# SDK provides low level components that make it very easy to use protocols such as TCP, UDP or Web sockets. These components will be the building blocks of my game server framework and hopefully, used by game developers or any other kind of project that requires networking for any of the above protocols.
