# Jordan Sdk Network Libraries

This C# SDK provides low level components that make it very easy to use protocols such as TCP, UDP or Web sockets. These components will be the building blocks of a C# socket server framework and hopefully, used by game developers or any other kind of project that requires networking for any of the above protocols.
